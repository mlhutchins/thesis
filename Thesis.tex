\abstract{

In this dissertation the capabilities of the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) are expanded to enable research of the source, propagation, and effects of lightning in the Earth-ionosphere system.
The main expansion of the network is the measurement of the very low frequency radiated energy from lightning.
The radiated stroke energy is directly proportional to the canonical peak current measurements of other ground based networks, but lacks the ability to determine the polarity of the stroke.
Stroke energy is used to develop a model of the networks relative detection efficiency; this internal model rates the coverage capabilities of the network compared to the networks best coverage.
Direct comparisons to other ground based networks are made to establish a stronger characterization of the networks absolute performance.
The final data product developed and used is the clustering of the lightning locations into both the active lightning regions of thunderstorms and flashes.
These three capabilities of the network allow for the tracing the effects of lightning and thunderstorms to the global electric circuit and their energy contribution to the magnetosphere.

The source of lightning is investigated in two regimes: within thunderstorms and between thunderstorms.
Within thunderstorms the time between flashes is found to be proportional to the resulting flash energy for differing thunderstorms, regions, and seasons.
Between thunderstorms the lightning energy is shown to differ between land and ocean, with oceanic thunderstorms producing stronger and fewer strokes.
The attenuation of the radiated energy with distance is seen to have an asymmetry with magnetic azimuth: eastward moving waves are attenuated less than westward moving waves.
This implies a complementary asymmetry in the strength of upward going whistler waves from a lightning source into the magnetosphere.
A second global contribution of thunderstorms is to the global electric circuit, it is shown that WWLLN can provide one of the first global continuous measurements of the thunderstorm current contribution to the global electric circuit.
