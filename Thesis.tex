\abstract{

In this dissertation the capabilities of the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) are expanded and examined.
The expansion of available data sources from the network allows for the research into the source, propagation, and effects of lightning in the Earth-ionosphere system.
The main expansion to the network discussed is the measurement of the far-field very low frequency radiated energy from lightning as measured by the WWLLN stations.
The radiated stroke energy is directly proportional to the canonical peak current measurements of other ground based networks, but lacks the ability to determine the polarity of the stroke.
Stroke energy is used to develop a model of the networks relative detection efficiency; an entirely internal model that rates the coverage ability of the network compared to the networks best coverage.
A final data product developed and used is the clustering of the lightning locations into both active lightning regions of thunderstorms and flashes.
These three new expansions to the network allow for the tracing the effects of lightning and thunderstorms to the global electric circuit and their energy contribution to the magnetosphere.


Using WWLLN the energy of lightning is shown to differ between continental and oceanic thunderstorms, with oceanic thunderstorms producing stronger strokes on average.
Further the energy in an individual thunderstorm is seen to be directly related to the time since the previous flash.
Once lightning energy is radiated away from the thunderstorm the attenuation of energy with distance is seen to have a strong asymmetry with magnetic azimuth: eastward moving waves are attenuated less than westward moving waves.
Implying a complementary asymmetry in the strength of upward going whistler waves from a lightning source.
The global thunderstorm contribution to the global electric circuit is also observed using WWLLN, providing one of the first global continuous measurements of the thunderstorm contribution.
Aside from their global electric circuit contribution, the overall properties of thunderstorms are investigate globally and regional in particular the relation between thunderstorm area and stroke rate.
