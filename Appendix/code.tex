This appendix discusses the distribution of WWLLN data files on the Flash series of computers along with the storage locations of routine processing code.
The code locations are given in terms of both their active locations and as the source control repositories, managed using git (http://git-scm.com).

\section{File Storage on Flash Machines}

There are several types of WWLLN data files, summarized in Table~\ref{code:table:fileType}.
The example filenames given in the table are for 31 December 2013, 5:10 UTC.
Most of the file types, with exception of WB-files, are located on \texttt{flashfile} on \texttt{/wd1/wwlln/}.
Each file type has it's own directory, denoted Afiles, AEfiles, etc., with flat file structures (except for R-files).
R-files, due to the large number generated, are broken into yearly and monthly folders of the form: \texttt{Rfiles/R[YYYY]/R[YYYY][MM]}.
Some, but not all, of the WWLLN data file directories have been copied to the other flashes on a need-basis and so the other flashes should not be considered a backup of the flashfile dataset.

\begin{table}[h!]

\caption{WWLLN Data Types}
\begin{tabular}{|p{.75in}|p{1.5in}|p{3.5in}|}

\hline
{\bf File Type} & {\bf Name} &	{\bf Description} \\

\hline
\rule{0pt}{3ex}
R-files	& \texttt{R20121231051000}	&	Raw packets sent by stations\\ 

\hline
\rule{0pt}{3ex}
A-files	& \texttt{A20121231.loc}	&	Lightning locations generated in real time\\ 

\hline
\rule{0pt}{3ex}
AP-files	& \texttt{AP20121231.loc}	&	Location data with station and E-field data of each stroke solution, generated daily with relocate-B\\ 

\hline
\rule{0pt}{3ex}
AE-files	& \texttt{AE20121231.loc}	&	Location and stroke energy data, generated daily by Bootstrap.\\ 

\hline
\rule{0pt}{3ex}
DE-files	& \texttt{DE20121231.mat}	&	Relative detection efficiency maps, as Matlab data.\\ 

\hline
\rule{0pt}{3ex}

\hline
\rule{0pt}{3ex}
WB-files	& \texttt{WB201212310510.dat}	&	Continuos wideband field data output by toga -r\\ 

\hline
\rule{0pt}{3ex}
T-files	& \texttt{T20131114\_Single.dat}	&	Station packet count record, TCurrent.dat is the current running record\\ 

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{code:table:fileType}
\end{table}
 
An example line from each of the R, A, AP, and AE files are given below with descriptors for each file.
R-files are the simplest with each line containing three columns:

\begin{verbatim}
10      3000.015563     2668
\end{verbatim}

The first number is the station ID, the second is the seconds from the start of the hour, and the last is the root integrated square electric field at the station, in uncalibrated sound card units.
For A-files each line if of the form:

\begin{verbatim}
2013/01/31,16:18:54.103460,  9.0621,-117.8276, 19.9,  9
\end{verbatim}

The first six numbers are the date (YYYY/MM/DD) and UTC time of the stroke (hh,mm,ss).
The next two are the stroke location in degrees north latitude and east longitude.
The final two are the timing uncertainty in microseconds and the number of WWLLN stations that participated in the stroke location.
AP-files are similar to A-files with additional information after the stroke location:

\begin{verbatim}
2013/02/12,00:00:07.142335,-10.4622,  20.0863, 13.4,  5, 17, 600, 19, 2084,
	 26, 453, 53, 225, 64, 2263
\end{verbatim}

Starting at \texttt{17,600} are pairs of numbers that give the station ID (\texttt{17}) and the field strength (\texttt{600}) in sound card units, the same value as in the R-files. Finally AE-files are similar to A-files but with three additional numbers:

\begin{verbatim}
2013/2/12,00:00:07.142335, -10.4622,  020.0863, 13.4, 5, 448.86, 114.87, 4
\end{verbatim}

The last three numbers correspond to the radiated VLF stroke energy in joules (\texttt{448.86}), the median absolute deviation of the energy value in joules (\texttt{114.87}), and the subset of stations that participated in the energy value solution (\texttt{4}).

T-files are records of how many packets a given station sent to \texttt{flash4} during the history of WWLLN.
Unlike the other files it is not automatically generated, rather it is written whenever it is updated through the \texttt{TfileUpdater.m} script in the \texttt{functions.git} repository.
Each line contains the date in days since 01/01/0000 and the counts for each station, where column 2 corresponds to station 0.

\section{Code Repositories}

All of my code should be stored on \texttt{flashfile} at \texttt{/home/mlhutch/}.
The operational code running every day is stored on \texttt{flash5} at \texttt{/home/mlhutch/matlab/bootstrap/} with a non-operational copy on \texttt{flashfile}.
The exact details of where the energy processing code is located, the necessary files, and similar code for the relative detection efficiency processing is covered in Appendix~\ref{thesis:appendix:energy}.
Aside from being stored in plaintext scripts, all of the code is also stored in a Git repository located on \texttt{flashfile:/home/mlhutch/Git} and hosted online on \href{http://github.com/mlhutchins}{\texttt{github.com/mlhutchins/}}.

The Git repositories have the advantage of multiple back ups, version control, easily portable, and easy to use.
A list of the WWLLN processing code and corresponding git repository is given in Table~\ref{code:table:repo}.
A basic primer on how to use git is given in Section~\ref{code:section:primer}; online resources are also readily available.

\section{Git Primer}
\label{code:section:primer}

Git (\href{http://git-scm.com}{\texttt{http://git-scm.com}}) is an open source distributed version control system available on all operating systems with very little system resources required.
Most often git is accessed through the command line but there are many graphical interfaces available.
I chose git for my research and code since it allows easy branching, constant backups (locally and on remote servers), and helps to organize code and projects.
A brief tutorial on git is available online: \href{http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started}{\texttt{http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started}} and \href{http://try.github.com/}{\texttt{http://try.github.com/}}.

Once git is installed on a host machine (\texttt{http://git-scm.com}, \texttt{apt-get install git}, or \texttt{yum install git-core}) repositories can be downloaded with the command:

\begin{verbatim}
git clone [user]@[server]:[repository] .
\end{verbatim}

This will copy (clone) the repository to the current directory as a folder of the same name as the repository. 
For example to copy over the energy processing repository listed in Table~\ref{code:table:repo} to the \texttt{matlab} directory:

\begin{verbatim}
cd ~/matlab
clone sferix@flash5.ess.washington.edu:/home/mlhutch/Git/bootstrap.git .
\end{verbatim}

Where the user can be anyone with permission to access that directory.
More information on how to use git for source control, instead of downloading the repositories, can be found in the online resources.

\section{Other Useful Matlab Code}

Some of the functions present in the functions.git repository are very useful and often critical to the routine WWLLN processing.
The function terminator.m is used to calculating the percentage of a VLF path that is in daylight and the percentage that is nighttime conditions.
It is written to take into a either a vector or scaler initial location, time, and end location.
The function \texttt{vdist.m} is from the MathWorks file exchange and calculated the great circle distance between two points on the ellipsoidal Earth.

Aside from these three functions there is a directory in the \texttt{functions.git} repository dedicated to reading and writing WWLLN file types.
In the directory \texttt{functions/IO} are a set of import functions to import A, AP, AE, R, T, and DE files.
There are also functions to read and write tab delimited data, the LWPC lookup tables (described in Appendix~\ref{thesis:appendix:energy}), and WWLLN \texttt{stations.dat} data.
All of these functions take in a given date (and possibly time) to find and load the desired file.
The file \texttt{dataPath.dat} lists locations that the import functions check for the data folders of the particular file type.
The default is to look for either \texttt{flashfile:/wd1/wwlln/} or \texttt{/wd2/} drives, but other locations can be added to this list as needed.
