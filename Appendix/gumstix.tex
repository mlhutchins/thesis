\subsection{Hardware Controls}

Pin GPIO145 is the pin that controls whether the preamp power supply is turned on or off.
When the pin is held low (value of 0) the power supply is on, when it is set high (value of 1) it is turned off.
The command to change a GPIO pin value is:

\begin{verbatim}
echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio145/value
\end{verbatim}

The two scripts {\bf preampOn.sh} and {\bf preampOff.sh} can be used to easily toggle the preamp power supply.

The default value for GPIO pins is to hold them high, so during boot the preamp turns off until the {\bf preampOn.sh} script can be called at the end of the boot sequence.

\subsection{GPS Interface}

The Trimble GPS communicates with the TSIP protocal, compared the NMEA of the previous GPS engine used.
The pythons script {\bf readTSIP.py} interprets the TSIP messages and reports the GPS status to the file gps.log and prints them to the console.
The console printing can be turned off by changing the variable print\_to\_console to False.

The program can be started and run in the background to produce a continues record of GPS activity.
The default location for the gps.log file is in the public\_html folder where it can be remotely checked through the service unit website.
