Placeholder for conclusion

Future work speculation and notes:

Network characterization:
  Leave one out detection efficiency study for station placement
  Variability in regional energy distributions over time
  Energy uncertainty as distance from main calibrated station
  Speed of light optimization
  Regional comparisons with CHUVA, ENTLN, GOES-R
  Flash multiplicity and subsequent stroke energies

Network improvements
  Additional calibrated stations for energy bootstrap calculation
  Optimum station placement prediction
  Relative detection efficiency using more robust measure

Cluster comparison to weather radar and case studies
  Thunderstorm property Variability

Global electric circuit balloon campaign and comparison to WWLLN
  Stroke count model, flash count model, thunderstorm count model

Whistler generation and coupling into the ionosphere, measurements with satellites such as RBSP

TGF production estimates using energy of detected TGFs

Thunderstorm parameterization and controls of flash rate and stroke energy
  Analysis of thunderstorm charging rate

Automatic whistler detection
