Over the course of this work WWLLN has been expanded to include several new features: energy per stroke, relative detection efficiency, flash clustering, and thunderstorm clustering.
These new features have been developed alongside new research and analysis using WWLLN by itself or in conjunction with other systems.
Most of the research completed naturally leads to more projects and research avenues that can be explored in the context of this work.
Several of the possibilites for research on WWLLN, thunderstorms, the global electric circuit, and other lightning processes are briefly discussed in this chapter.

\section{WWLLN}
